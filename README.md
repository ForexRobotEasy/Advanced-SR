## Description
The Advanced SR Forex software is designed to identify market trends and support/resistance levels to determine optimal entry and exit points for trades. This code serves as a sample implementation of the software's trading strategy.

## Installation
To use this code, you will need to have a MetaTrader 5 platform installed. Follow these steps to install the Advanced SR Forex software:

1. Open your MetaTrader 5 platform.
2. Go to 'File' > 'Open Data Folder'.
3. In the opened folder, navigate to 'MQL5' > 'Experts'.
4. Create a new folder named 'AdvancedSR' and copy the code file into this folder.
5. Restart MetaTrader 5 to compile the code.

## Usage
1. Apply the Advanced SR Forex software to your desired currency pair and chart timeframe.
2. Ensure that the code file is properly compiled and attached to the chart.
3. The software will automatically analyze the market and open trades based on the defined strategy.

## Strategy
The Advanced SR Forex software uses a trend-based strategy to determine trade entries. The code checks the current market trend and executes trades accordingly. If the market is trending upwards and the support level is broken, a buy trade is opened. Conversely, if the market is trending downwards and the resistance level is broken, a sell trade is opened.

## Support and Resistance Levels
The code utilizes support and resistance levels to determine trade entries. These levels are not explicitly defined in the code and should be implemented in the `GetMarketTrend`, `IsSupportLevelBroken`, and `IsResistanceLevelBroken` functions. These functions need to be implemented separately based on your desired logic for determining support and resistance levels.

## Closing Trades
The code includes functionality to close open trades when certain conditions are met. If the profit of a trade reaches the defined profit target or exceeds the defined stop loss, all open trades will be closed.
